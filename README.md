Welcome to DataAtNight #1, February 8, 2015! We've created this repository with some sample datasets so you can go ahead and get hacking.

If you want to run the iPython notebook, the easiest way to get started is to install the Anaconda Python distribution, which comes with all the standard scientific packages.

https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/

Then, install Scikit-Learn, the standard machine learning package in Python:

> conda install scikit-learn

Finally, to run the ipython notebook, navigate to the directory where you downloaded it and run:

> ipython notebook

If you're on Ubuntu, you can run (instead of Anaconda):

> sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose python-pip
> pip install --user --install-option="--prefix=" -U scikit-learn
